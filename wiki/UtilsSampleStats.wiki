#summary methods to calculate summary statistics on a sample of double values

=!SampleStats=

*package:* jaitools.numeric

==Description==

The !SampleStats class provides static methods to calculate summary statistics for a sample of double-valued data. It is used by [Jiffle Jiffle] and the KernelStats operator and is also available for general use.

The following methods are provided:

 * max - maximum sample value
 * mean - arithmetic mean
 * median - median sample value
 * min - minimum sample value
 * mode - most frequently occuring sample value
 * range - maximum - minimum
 * sdev - sample standard deviation
 * variance - sample variance

Each method has two parameters: a Double array containing the sample values; and a boolean flag specifying whether NaN values should be ignored or not. If !NaNs are not ignored, all methods will return NaN if any of the sample values are NaN.
