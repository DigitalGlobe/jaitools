==Image classes==
 * DiskMemImage - a writable tiled image that uses disk and memory caching for its data

==Operators==
 * KernelStats - calculates one or more statistics for a pixel's neighbourhood
 * MaskedConvolve - convolution of a subset of image pixels
 * RangeLookup - a lookup transformation defined by source image value ranges
 * [Regionalize] - identifies regions of uniform value with user-specified tolerance
 * ZonalStats - summary statistics for data image values within zone image regions

==Operator helper classes==
 * KernelFactory - creates KernelJAI objects with a variety of configurations
 * KernelUtil - various methods to modify and examine kernel objects

==Image scripting==
 * [Jiffle Jiffle] - a scripting language and interpreter for image creation and analysis

==Support classes==
 * [UtilsRange Range] - implements numeric intervals and comparisons
 * [UtilsSampleStats SampleStats] - summary statistics
 * [UtilsStreamingSampleStats StreamingSampleStats] - smmary statistics for very long sequences of data
 * [UtilsTileCache DiskMemTileCache] - a JAI !TileCache implementation that uses disk and memory storage
