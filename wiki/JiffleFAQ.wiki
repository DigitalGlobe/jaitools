#summary Jiffle Frequently Asked Questions

<wiki:toc />

===Why ?===

Because it wasn't there. 

Because I wanted to play with [http://www.antlr.org ANTLR].

Because sometimes you would rather write a simple script than chain together a series of JAI operations explicitly for an image analysis task. 

Because it lends itself to being an easy to learn, application scripting language for your users.

===Can it deal with large images ?===

Jiffle uses JAI iterators for input and output so you can work with large tiled images.

===What image data types does Jiffle deal with ?===

Internally, Jiffle treats all values as doubles including pseudo-integer values for `true` (1) and `false` (0) in boolean expressions. Input images can be any data type: pixel values will be converted to double when they are read. Output images should be type double.

===Does it deal with multi-band images===

Not yet.
