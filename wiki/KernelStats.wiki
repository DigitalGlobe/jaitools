#summary Calculates one or more statistics for values in a pixel's neighbourhood

=!KernelStats=

==Description==

This operator calculates neighbourhood statistics for an input image. In JAI parlance it is a Collection mode operator because it can produce multiple output images, one for each statistic requested, from a single invocation.

You define the neighbourhood to use with a !KernelJAI object (see the KernelFactory class). The operator will place this kernel over each source image pixel, collect the values in the pixel neighbourhood, and calculates each requested statistic.

Note: the above describes what we're aiming to happen. What actually happens in
the current code is that the kernel is passed over the input image for each
statistic which is obviously inefficient.
