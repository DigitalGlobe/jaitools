#summary page dedicated to the implementation of Jiffle in the development version of JGrass

= JGrass aims to use Jiffle =

This page is dedicated to the results of the integration of Jiffle in [http://www.jgrass.org JGrass], a GIS based on the [http://udig.refractions.nert uDig] framework and dedicated to geomorphological and hydrological terrain analyses.
As such Jiffle is a mandatory tool for analyses of raster maps.


= Introduction =

For testing purposes the spearfish dataset it used, since it is a free dataset and avalable [http://grass.itc.it/download/data6.php here].

As introduction it is good to know that JGrass currently bases on [http://grass.osgeo.org/ GRASS]'s [http://grass.itc.it/grass64/manuals/html64_user/r.mapcalc.html r.mapcalc] tool, and has a nifty gui for that one. For these tests the mapcalc of GRASS has been replaced by Jiffle. *Same gui, a bit different usage (Jiffle has more features), same results.* Important that the author of Jiffle has been so kind to work trying to keep as long as possible backwards compatibility with GRASS's r.mapcalc.

So let's start the fun!

= Tests showcase =

Our starting point will be and elevation model and an aspect map. Here it all starts:

And that is the tool we will use Jiffle with:

== a simple division ==

Lets' try something easy such as dividing a map by two:

{{{
elevation.dem / 2.0
}}}

and the result is as expected:

Don't be missleaded by the colormap. That can be changed in anuy moment and when a map is created in JGrass a default rainbow colormap is created.
